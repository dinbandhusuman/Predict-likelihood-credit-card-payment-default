# Predict-likelihood-credit-card-payment-default
The bank performs a charge-off on delinquent credit cards and eats the losses. If only there was a way to predict which customers had the highest probability of defaulting so it may be preventedâ€¦

Problem

Can we reliably predict who has is likely to default? If so, the bank may be able to prevent the loss by providing the customer with alternative options (such as forbearance or debt consolidation, etc.). I will use various machine learning classification techniques to perform my analysis.
